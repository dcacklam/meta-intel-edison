## What's new for this release
 1. Linux make 5.15.81 LTS the default kernel, upgrade U-Boot to v2022.10
    We also provide v6.0.0 (testing) and v5.15.79-rt54 (LTS PREEMPT_RT kernel) for development purposes.
 2. Update to Yocto Honister.
 3. Build all IIO kernel modules, add libiio, libserialport. Together this forms a complete replacement for MRAA abd UPM.
 4. Add documentation for using ACPI to define an IIO sensor ([4.6-libiio](4.6-libiio.html)).
 5. Worked around long standing issue in kernel usb: dwc3 module so we can drop our " TODO: driver core: Break infinite loop when deferred probe can't be satisfied" patch.
 6. Work around for 32b kernel not booting for kernel 5.13 and higher (disable CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR)
