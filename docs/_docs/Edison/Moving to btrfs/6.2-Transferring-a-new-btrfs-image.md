## Automatically building and installing a `btrfs` snapshot
First make sure you have run `btrfsSnapshot.py` once (and only once) on your image, see [Automatic conversion](6.1-How-to-switch-to-btrfs#automatic-conversion)

`btrfsSnapshot.py` will also produce a compressed btrfs snapshot `out/current/build/tmp/deploy/images/edison/edison-image-edison.snapshot.7z`. The snapshot containing the rootfs has the name `@new`.

This can be send over-the-air (OTA) to a booted Edison assuming it is accessible with `ssh root@edison.local`:
```
meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -i
```

## Booting the `@new` rootfs
You can now boot `@new` image by interrupting U-Boot and running:
```
run do_altboot
```

Or from linux:
```
reboot alt
```

{% include note.html content="You have only transferred the root image, without `@boot` and `modules` at this point, so the new image will boot with the existing kernel. If you want to install multiple kernels read [Installing an alternate kernel](6.3-Installing-an-alternate-kernel)." %}

## Manually building and installing a `btrfs` image
{% include note.html content="If you have the `btrfs` patches there is no need to do these manual steps. These are just here for reference purposes." %}

These steps will create a `btrfs` image in conjunction with the ext4 image. However, `btrfs` allows you to have multiple subvolumes in a single pool. We will leave the existing subvolume in @ and put the newly built in @new.

### Manually create a `btrfs` rootfs
In edison-image-minimal.bb change:

```
 # Specify rootfs image type
-IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext4 live"
+IMAGE_FSTYPES = "btrfs ext4 live"
```
### Create a snapshot file
Mount the `btrfs` image in tmp/deploy/images/edison/:
```
mkdir tmp
udisksctl loop-setup -f edison-image-edison.btrfs --no-user-interaction
sudo `btrfs` su snap -r tmp tmp/@new
sudo `btrfs` send tmp/@new/ > edison-image-edison.snapshot
sudo umount tmp
```
### Manually send snapshot to Edison
```
ssh root@edison.local "umount /mnt"
ssh root@edison.local "mount /dev/disk/by-partlabel/rootfs /mnt"
cat edison-image-edison.snapshot | ssh root@edison.local "btrfs receive /mnt"
ssh root@edison.local "btrfs property set -ts /mnt/@new ro false"
```
