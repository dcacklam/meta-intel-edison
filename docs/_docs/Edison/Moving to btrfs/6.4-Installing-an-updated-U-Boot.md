## Building an updated U-Boot
With U-Boot v2020-04 all required elements to properly boot a vanilla linux kernel are in upstream. `meta-intel-edison` adds some non-essential patches on top, as well as enabling `btrfs` support.

U-Boot is automatically built as part of the regular image build.

## Install updated U-Boot Over The Air (OTA)
This is assuming Intel Edison is running and you can log in with `ssh root@edison.local`.

From the directory `out/current/build`:
```
 ../../../meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -b
```

## Install updated U-Boot Env Over The Air (OTA)

```
../../../meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -e
```

## Install updated U-Boot with DFU (USB)
