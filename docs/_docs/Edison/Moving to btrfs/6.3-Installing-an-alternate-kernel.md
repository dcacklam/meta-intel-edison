## Building an alternative kernel
The kernel version must be different from the one already installed.

{% include note.html content="This is because we will be installing through the package manager and the package names need to be different from the kernel already installed. Also, the kernel find it's modules in /lib/modules in a subdirectory with the kernel's version in the name." %}

Build kernel and initrd using `make image`. This will also rebuild the entire image.

## Start the apt repository
Now create a package index and serve the repository as described [here](5.0-Creating-a-deb-repository).

## Modifying Edison's installed kernels

### Install kernel and kernel modules
This can be updated over-the-air (OTA) to a booted Edison assuming it is accessible with `ssh root@edison.local`:
```
meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -k
```

### Update kernel and kernel modules
If you rebuild your kernel without changing the kernel version you can update it on Edison:
```
meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -u
```

### Remove kernel and kernel modules
If you want to remove an installed kernel:
```
meta-intel-edison/utils/flash/btrfsFlashOta.sh -r=5.10.0
```

Here 5.10.0 is an example of a string that represents a part of the kernel package name that uniquely removes only one kernel.

## Boot into the new kernel

Set the U-Boot environment variable `switch` to `1` so that U-Boot will try to boot the new kernel on reboot.

From linux
```
fw_setenv switch 1
reboot
```

U-Boot will change the kernel, set the U-Boot environment variable `boot_count` to `1`. A successfully booted kernel will set `boot_count` to `0`. If on boot `boot_count == 1`, U-Boot will recognize that booting the new kernel failed and will automatically revert to the old kernel.

## Reverting back to the old kernel
Setting `boot_count` to `1`, will force U-Boot to booting the old kernel.
```
fw_setenv boot_count 1
reboot
```
